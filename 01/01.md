This tutorial is the first part of a series where different aspects of programming with `EOS` are explained. This part will explain how to find public `api_endpoints` and interact with them using `Python`.

- Perform POST requests

#### Requirements

#### Difficulty

- basic

### Tutorial



#### Setup
Download the file from [Github](https://github.com/amosbastian/steempy-tutorials/tree/master/part_26). There is 1 file `ff` which takes 1 argument 'block_id'

Run scripts as following:
`> python eos.py 5`

#### Find a public API endpoint
`EOS` uses 21 `block producers(BP)` which are knowns to everyone. There are network monitoring tools like the website [eosnetworkmonitor](http://eosnetworkmonitor.io/) where this information is published live.

However, finding the `public api's` for each `BP` requires a bit more digging. Every `BP` is required to host a file `bp.json` which can be found by taking their `public url` and adding `/bp.json` to it like `bp.eosnewyork.io` + `\bp.json` = `bp.eosnewyork.io/bp.json`. In this file at the bottom information about the `api_endpoint` is located. These `api_endpoint's` can be used to make `API` calls with  for example `python`. In this example http://api.eosnewyork.io will be used in conjunction with `Python`.

**Note: Not every `BP` has an `api_endpoint`**

#### Perform GET requests

A full list of all possible `API requests` can be found [here](). They fall into one of two categories. `GET` and `POST` requests. To handle these `API calls` the `requests` library is used.

```
import requests

```
The `url` consists of the `api_endpoint` concatenated with the `api_request`. Performing a `GET` request return a `json` structure which has to be decoded before printing.

```
api_endpoint = 'http://api.eosnewyork.io'
api_request = '/v1/chain/get_info'
url = api_endpoint + api_request

print(requests.get(url=url).json())

```

#### Perform POST requests
The difference between the a `POST` and a `GET` request is that for a `POST` data is posted to the server which then results into a `text` response. Normally a `dictionary` containing the `variables` would have been sufficient, however the `EOS` nodes only accept a `string` of the `dict`. In this example the dict `{"block_num_or_id": <block_id> }` is posted to the server. The parameters can be changed to retrieve different data.


```
block = int(sys.argv[1])
api_endpoint = 'http://api.eosnewyork.io'
api_request = '/v1/chain/get_block'
url = api_endpoint + api_request
parameters = '{"block_num_or_id":' + f'{block}' + '}'

print(requests.post(url=url, data=parameters).text)
```


#### Running the script
With everything set up all is left is running the code. Doing so will start retrieving the `blocks` and look for `transfers` in each `block`. Each `transfer` is then stored in the local `database`.

```
python get_blocks.py 23892389 100
Booted
Connected to: https://api.steemit.com

Block:  23892389

Block:  23892390

Block:  23892391

Block:  23892392

Block:  23892488
